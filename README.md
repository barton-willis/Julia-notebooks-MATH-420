IJulia notebooks for Numerical Analysis (MATH 420)

These are IJulia notebook files that I used to teach Numerical Analysis at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. The course textbook was _First Semester in Numerical Analysis with Julia_, by Giray Ã–kten (see https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/710).

Some files are fairly polished others are not.
