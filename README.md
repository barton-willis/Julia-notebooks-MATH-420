# IJulia notebooks for Numerical Analysis (MATH 420)

Most files in this repository are IJulia notebook files that I used to teach Numerical Analysis (MATH 420) at the University of Nebraska at Kearney in spring 2021. The course textbook was _First Semester in Numerical Analysis with Julia_, by Giray Ã–kten (see https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/710), but our class didn't exclusively follow this book.

Some files are fairly polished others are not. Some worksheets were created just hours before class and were not heavily proofread, but others were created years before the class and have been refined a bit more.

I've been working through these worksheets and attempting to fix the spelling and grammar errors, repair broken url links, append documentation strings to most functions, change to idiomatic Julia, and to make sure the worksheets all run using Julia 1.10. For the most part, I'm trying to avoid the temptation to extend these IJulia notebooks beyond what we did in class--I would like to mostly preserve these worksheets to what we actually did in class. Eventually, I might attempt to improve all the graphics in these notebooks to be nicely labeled and to use a uniform color scheme.

If you have suggestions for improvements, please communicate them to me.
