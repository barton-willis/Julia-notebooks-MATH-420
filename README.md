# IJulia notebooks for Numerical Analysis (MATH 420)

Most files in this repository are IJulia notebook files that I used to teach Numerical Analysis (MATH 420) at the University of Nebraska at Kearney in spring 2021. The course textbook was _First Semester in Numerical Analysis with Julia_, by Giray Ã–kten (see https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/710), but our class didn't exclusively follow this textbook.

Some files are fairly polished others are not. Some worksheets were created just hours before class and we not heavily proofread, but others have been refined.

I've been working through these worksheets and attempting to fix the errors, append documentation strings to most functions, change to more idiomatic Julia, and to make sure the worksheets all run using Julia 1.10. I'm trying to avoid the temptation to extend these IJulia notebooks beyond what we did in class.

If you have suggestions for improvements, please communicate them to me.
