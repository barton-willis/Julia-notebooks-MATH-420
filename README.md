Most files in this repository are IJulia notebook files that I used to teach Numerical Analysis (MATH 420) at the University of Nebraska at Kearney in Spring 2021. The primary textbook was _First Semester in Numerical Analysis with Julia_, by Giray Ã–kten (see [this link](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/710)). Our class included some material on numerical solution of differential equations that isn't in the textbook, and we didn't cover some content in the textbook. Plus, we went over more material than just what's in these worksheets.

For additional resources for teaching numerical analysis that I have created, see [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/barton-willis/MATH-420-CYBR-304).

Some files are fairly polished, others are not. Some worksheets were created just hours before class and were not heavily proofread, but others were created years before the class and have been refined a bit more. Additionally, some worksheets include brief explanations of the methods employed, while others do not.

I've been working through these worksheets, and I am attempting to fix the spelling and grammar errors, repair broken URL links, append documentation strings to most functions, change to more idiomatic Julia, and to ensure the worksheets run using Julia 1.10. Eventually, I might attempt to improve all the graphics in these notebooks to be nicely labeled and to use a uniform color scheme.

It's my aim to mostly preserve these worksheets as they were actually used in class. For the most part, I'm trying to avoid the temptation to extend these IJulia notebooks beyond the class content and rewriting them using more formal language. But I'm open to extending these worksheets to give more explanations of the theory behind the methods.

If you have suggestions for improvements, please communicate them to me.
